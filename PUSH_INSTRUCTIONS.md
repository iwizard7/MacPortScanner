## 🎯 What Happens After Push

1. **GitHub Actions will trigger** and run tests
2. **Release workflow will build** the DMG installer
3. **Automated release** will be created with the DMG file
4. **Users can download** the ready-to-use application

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After pushing, verify:
- [ ] Repository is accessible at https://github.com/iwizard7/MacPortScanner
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows are running
- [ ] Release v0.1.0 is created with DMG file
- [ ] README displays correctly
- [ ] All files are properly organized

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If GitHub Actions fail:
1. Check the workflow logs
2. Ensure all file paths are correct
3. Verify Xcode project configuration
4. Check Rust dependencies

If build fails locally:
1. Run `./build.sh` to test local build
2. Check system requirements (macOS 14+, Xcode 15+, Rust)
3. Verify all dependencies are installed

## 🎉 Success!

Once pushed successfully, your MacPortScanner will be:
- ✅ Available on GitHub with professional presentation
- ✅ Automatically built and released via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Ready for users to download and install
- ✅ Set up for future development and contributions
